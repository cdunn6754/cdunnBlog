<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>I am interested in hosting my personal site on AWS (Amazon Web Services). Previously I have set it up on an elastic beanstalk instance through AWS and that worked great. I am interested now in trying to set up the server and software myself. To do this I want to set up a ec2 instance and install the server (nginx), database (postgresql), web server gateway interface (uWSGI) and python/django (v. 2.0) myself. I have never done this before and am trying to transition into web developement, this seems like a good way to learn a lot of the background quickly. I am following a number of other reference and tutorials to do this and will try to cite them as they come up. The primary resource is another tutorial at <a href="http://oliverelliott.org/article/computing/tut_aws/">oliverelliot.com</a>. The following tutorial is very similar to his but is updated with all of the little changes that occur over a few years.</p>
<p>Instead of deploying my entire personal site I will, for simplicity, be using a simple Django site that has been developed for a previous tutorial (cite).</p>

<p>The first step is to setup an AWS account if you don't already have one <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>. Once you have setup an account you can access the online gui AWS console <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/console/">aws.amazon.com/console/</a>. This allows you to interact with your AWS account and setup new cloud computing resources. An example of what my console landing page looks like is presented below.</p>

<p>There is a long list of potential operating systems to select from. Beyond the operating system different AMIs also come with different software installed. Since we are interested in doing it ourselves we will use the first option, Amazon Linux 2 AMI. Note that in this tutorial we will only be using basic and popular packages (e.g. vanilla nginx and Django) if you need a more esoteric package that may not be as easy to install on the Amazon linux you should go with an Ubuntu or RHEL OS AMI instead.</p>

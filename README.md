# My Personal Website

There are two apps within this project:
1. `content`:
   This houses the post models themselves as well as post topic models.

2. `blogUser`:
   This is very much still a work in progress. Originally I had a traditional
   blog structure where anyone could sign up and post content. I realized as
   I progressed that I wanted it to be my personal portfolio site so had
   to make some changes. Currently this app is not used but I may
   incoporate it in the future to allow people to leave comments on posts.


This is the development version of the site. This site is deployed at
[clintdunn.org](https://clintdunn.org).
